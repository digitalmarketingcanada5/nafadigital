                Information We Collect
              </h3>
              <p>
                Canadian privacy legislation defines personal information
                broadly as information about "an identifiable individual" or as
                information that allows an individual to be identified. The
                types of personal information that we may collect from you from
                time to time include: your name, address, telephone number,
                e-mail address, and birthdate. In addition, from time to time,
                we may ask you to provide us with more detailed information
                regarding your interests, occupation, and background. For
                example, we sometimes ask our subscribers to complete surveys in
                order to get a better sense of who they are and what topics may
                be of interest to them. Finally, from time to time, we may
                acquire demographic and other information about you (e.g. your
                occupation and interests) in order to serve you better.
